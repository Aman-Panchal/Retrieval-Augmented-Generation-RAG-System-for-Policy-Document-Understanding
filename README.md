📄 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Policy Document QA

This project demonstrates an end-to-end RAG pipeline that allows querying large policy documents using vector search and LLMs. Built with LangChain, FAISS, and transformer-based models, the system can retrieve relevant chunks and generate high-quality, context-aware answers.

🧠 Objective

Enable natural language question-answering over long policy documents by combining semantic search with generative models (RAG approach).

🔧 Tech Stack

    🧠 LangChain for chaining components (retriever, prompts, LLM)

    🔍 FAISS for fast vector-based retrieval

    📄 TextLoader for loading .txt policy files

    ✂️ RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for smart chunking

    🤗 Hugging Face Transformers or OpenAI LLM for response generation

✅ Step-by-Step Workflow
1. 📥 Document Loading

    Use TextLoader from LangChain to load multiple .txt policy documents.

    Combine all text into a single corpus.

loader = TextLoader("data/policy1.txt")
docs = loader.load()


2. ✂️ Text Chunking

    Apply RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to split documents into manageable chunks with overlaps for context preservation.

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=800,
    chunk_overlap=0
)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)


3. 🧮 Embedding and Vector Store Creation

    Convert text chunks into vector embeddings using HuggingFaceEmbeddings or OpenAIEmbeddings.

    Store vectors in FAISS for fast semantic retrieval.

vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embedding)
vectorstore.save_local("vectorstore/")

4. 🔍 MultiQuery Retriever 

    Optionally enrich retrieval using MultiQueryRetriever, which asks the LLM to reformulate the question in multiple ways to retrieve diverse documents.

5. 🤖 LLM Chain for Response Generation

    Use a PromptTemplate to structure the query.

    Inject retrieved context into a summarization or Q&A prompt.

    Generate output using LLMChain or a Runnable sequence in LangChain.

6. 🔄 Full Chain Execution

The final chain performs:

    Input question preprocessing

    Document retrieval via FAISS

    Context construction

    LLM prompt generation and response parsing

result = final_chain.invoke({"question": "What is the purpose of the AI Ethics policy?"})
print(result)


📊 Output Example

Input:
"What is the purpose of the Comprehensive AI Ethics Policy Document?"

Output:

{
  "summary": "The policy outlines the company's commitment to ethical AI development and its responsible use.",
  "category": "AI Governance"
}

🚀 Future Enhancements

    UI integration (e.g., Streamlit or Gradio)

    Long document support using memory and history

    Support for uploading PDFs via PyMuPDF or pdfplumber

    Switch from FAISS to Weaviate, Pinecone, or ChromaDB
